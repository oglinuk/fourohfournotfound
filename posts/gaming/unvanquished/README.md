# Unvanquished

"Unvanquished is a free, open-source first-person strategy game shooter,
pitting technologically advanced human soldiers against hordes of highly
adaptable aliens. Players can choose from either team, providing for an
entirely different experience on both sides, as humans focus on
long-range firepower while aliens rely instead on quick movement and
stealth. The goal of each match is to destroy the enemy base, preventing
members of the opposing team from spawning. Upgrades for both teams are
earned by a combination of individual performance and team map control,
unlocking access to more powerful weapons and equipment for the humans,
and larger, more ferocious forms for the aliens."
